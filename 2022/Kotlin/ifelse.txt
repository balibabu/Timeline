Note - If Statemens as Expressions
If statement as an expression
In Kotlin you can use if statement as an expression, for example, you can assign the result of if-else to a variable. Let's look at an example

//create a variable for testing all condition
 val age = 16
//create a variable for drinkingAge 
 val drinkingAge = 21
//create a variable for votingAge
 val votingAge = 18
//create a variable for drivingAge
 val drivingAge = 16
 
//Assign the if statement to a variable
val currentAge =  if (age >=drinkingAge){
println("Now you may drink in the US")
//return the value for this block
    drinkingAge
 }else if(age >=votingAge){
println("You may vote now")
//return the value for this block
    votingAge
 }else if (age>=drivingAge){
println("You may drive now")
//return the value for this block
    drivingAge
 }else{
println("You are too young")
//return the value for this block
     age
 }
//print the age for the passing condition
print("current age is $currentAge")
Now when we run with the value of age as 16, it prints

You may drive now current age is 16

When we run with a value of age as 22, it prints

Now you may drink in the US current age is 21

So it actually prints the passing block with the equivalent age.
