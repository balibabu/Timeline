Please don't simply use Kotlin's powerful type inference feature for this.

For example, write

var age : Short = 25

and not

var age = 25

even though both are correct. This is just for testing your understanding of the different basic data types.
All of them should be "var", except for the pi value and 13.37, use "val" here.
Try to use descriptive and useful names
