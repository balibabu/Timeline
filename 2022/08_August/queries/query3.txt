select sum(city.population) from city inner join
country on CITY.CountryCode = COUNTRY.Code
where country.continent='Asia';


Given the CITY and COUNTRY tables, query the names of all the continents (COUNTRY.Continent) and their respective average city populations (CITY.Population) rounded down to the nearest integer.

Note: CITY.CountryCode and COUNTRY.Code are matching key columns.

select country.continent, floor(avg(city.population)) from city join
country on CITY.CountryCode = COUNTRY.Code
group by country.continent;
