states -> Objects should be replaceable with their sub-types without affecting the
		  correctness of the program

solutions:
1. Break the hierarchy
2. Tell, Don't ask

for 1st eg: racing car should extends from Vehicle not Car, and Car extends Vehicle
			ostrich should not extends from Bird, because it can't fly
			
for 2nd eg: We should not check the instance of object and then type cast 
			into some other class objects
